    "* We assume a five-year project. That is, the apartment is purchased, rented out, and then sold after five years. This is a rather short project, considering how illiquid the real-estate market is and how few transactions an average person makes in this market during their lifetime. However, this horizon is definitely feasible. Moreover, one could think, for example, about a 10-year investment as a combination of two back-to-back investment projects. The benefit of considering five years is that that this way, we make housing investment comparable with investment into 5-year government bonds, which are very popular today. Also, 5-year horizon implies that there are no capital-gain taxes in case of both housing and bond investment.\n",
    "* We assume that the stamp duty equal to 4% has to be paid upon the purchase. The underlying assumption is that the apartment is bought on the market to be rented out to a third party, and that there were no additional property trades within one year before and after the purchase (which would complicated the analysis tremendously).\n",
    "* We assume that the owner signs a one-year rental contract with the tenant with a fixed rental rate, and then the rental rate is increased after every year in order to catch up with the market rate. This is in line with the common practice that the rental rate is re-negotiated once a year."
